      <h1>Scuba Diving Course</h1>
      <p>
        If you have already tried scuba diving, and you liked it, and you want to
        know more, be more independent <br />under the water and dive in the
        places for certified divers, then the Open Water Diver diving course in
        Phuket <br />is where you need to start. The course is divided into
        several parts: theory, practice, and of course, diving itself.<br />It's
        simple: you go through all these parts of training in parallel: theory and
        practice in the pool or shallow water, <br />and then real dives in the
        sea. During the training, you will learn everything that a diver should
        know: how the <br />equipment works and how to use it and take care of it;
        where and when you can dive and how to plan your dives, <br />how to swim
        under the water. You will learn so much that every day will bring you more
        and more vivid impressions!
